# Batch builds (YAML)
# Each entry overrides defaults in config/defaults.yaml
# Alpine does not have LTS releases; use the latest three minor versions.
# VMID is auto-generated as: {node_digit}{distro_digit}{version}

builds:
  # Alpine cloud images use the full VERSION (e.g., 3.23.0) in the filename
  # but RELEASE (e.g., 3.23) in the path.
